fluidtracker todo:

*** shift+f2: save as

opens a dialog box where it shows the current folder like this:

/
home/
rb/
projects/
appbase/
examples/
audio/
<- the cursor is here

as I start typing, I get autocomplete suggestions which can be completed with Tab (with cycling through alternatives)

if I auto-completed a directory, I also enter to it. if I press tab again, I cycle among alternatives, if I press something else, I select something inside the selected directory.

alt-backspace deletes back to the last /, pressing alt-backspace repeatedly chdirs back towards root

pressing enter finalizes the selection

if it's an existing file, it asks for overwrite

*** f2: save

"save" if there is an associated file
"save as" if there is none yet

saved files get .flt extension (fluid tracker)

*** pass path of flt file on command line to open it

passing an sf2 file at the same time opens the flt and replaces the soundfont with the given one

at the next save, the flt will refer to the new soundfont

*** f3: load flt

*** shift+f3: load soundfont

*** f1: help

opens as a read-only text pane, left/right to switch between pages

*** f9/f10/f11/f12: edit event code / track code / pattern code / global code

opens an editor in which I can edit Lua code for the above

event code executes when an event is played

stuff defined in track code can be used by all events of the track
stuff defined in pattern code can be used in all tracks of the pattern and events of those tracks
stuff defined in global code can be used anywhere

when one of these codes are updated, the depending codes automatically use the updated definitions

*** shift+f9: edit label code

this code shall return a string which will be used as the 3-character label of the event
can use anything defined in event/track/pattern/global code

*** x/c/v

x: cut event
c: copy event
v: paste event

*** shift-selection

holding down shift and moving selects an area

x/c/v cuts/copies/pastes the selected area
